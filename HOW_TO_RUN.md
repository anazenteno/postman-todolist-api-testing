   ```

   git clone https://github.com/anazenteno/repository-postman.git
   cd repository-postman
   ```

   - Click **Save**.
   - Click **Run** to open the **Collection Runner**.
   - Select the `Todoist-Tasks` environment.
   - Click **Start Run** to execute the tests.

## üìä Generating HTML Reports with Newman

1. **Edit the batch script `collection-todoist.bat` using any text editor:**

   ```bash
   set POSTMAN_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  # Your Postman API Key  
   set COLLECTION_UID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   # Collection UID  
   set ENVIRONMENT_UID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  # Environment UID
   ```

2. **Notes:**
   - Generate your API Key from your Postman account.
   - To get your **Collection UID**, send a request to:  
     `https://api.getpostman.com/collections`  
   - To get your **Environment UID**, send a request to:  
     `https://api.getpostman.com/environments`  
   - Use your Postman API Key for authentication in both cases.

3. **Run the report:**
   - Double-click the `collection-todoist.bat` script.
   - The script will automatically fetch the latest version of the collection and environment from Postman.
   - It will run the tests and generate an HTML report in the same folder.
   - Look for the browser icon file (HTML) and open it to view the report.
